Blocks any tweet asking @grok a question. 

Currently absolute most bare-bones implementation

TODO:

-On/off switch
-quick reveal/hide switch so you don't have to refresh when you want them to appear
-more specific filters (so you can hide people asking some variation of "@grok is this true" and such)
-make sure it only works on replies and on the right page
