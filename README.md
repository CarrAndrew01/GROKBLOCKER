Blocks any tweet asking @grok a question. 

Currently absolute most bare-bones implementation

TODO:

-more specific filters (so you can hide people asking some variation of "@grok is this true" and such)
-make it also block replies to @grok posts, as sometimes they show up anyway (speaking of which, what decides whether a reply shows up on the comments screen or not? Groks never seem to which is why I haven't noticed until now)

KNOWN BUGS:

-When enabling from either switch, it won't update until scrolling happens.
